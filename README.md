# Building a chess game with C++
After spending 2+ years building websites with `NextJS`, I have decided to leave my comfort zone and dive into other areas of coding. At first, I started learning `Rust` as it was becoming very popular these days. But a couple of days later, out of nowhere, it hit me: I had to learn a language that is considered extremely difficult (I don't know why). And here I am, building a chess game in `C++` with `SFML`.

## Goals
My main goal is to learn `C++` at a level where I know what to use and when. Besides that, I want to get better at writing clean code, as it is essential to be able to understand what I wrote even 2-3 months later. Last but definitely not least, I want to build a chess game that is locally playable with two people and with an AI that I build. Here is a list of the features that I want to add to this project.

- [ ] Locally playable chess game (turn-based)
- [ ] Chess AI
- [ ] Multiple Piece & Board themes
- [ ] Multiplayer support 🤯
- [ ] Different Game Modes (Chess960, BlindChess, etc..)
- [ ] and many more... [I will update here as I complete the features and think of new ones.]


## Inspirations
This project was mainly inspired by my interest in chess and Sebastian Lague's  Youtube video named "[Coding Adventure: Chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk)."
